Q-2. Explain different data types available in  C.
Ans:-The individual words and punctuation  marks of token.In c              Programming,the smallest individual is known as C                           token.
           There are six type of Token are:-
               1)Keywords  :-
                                         eg-do,While
                            It must be return in lowercase.There are 32                             Keywords in C.It is reserved words in C.
                                 It is of 4 type :-a)auto
                              b)double 
                              c)int
                              d)struct
                                         
               2)Constants:-

                                            eg-number,sum
               3)Identifier:- 
                                    First caracter must be an Alphabet or                                      Underscore.It consists of combination of any                                 leters,digits or underscore(no other).Only 31                                       character are significant.It not use                                         keywords
                                           eg-   -76,89
                4)Strings:- 

                                           eg-  "HTF","PRIT"
                  5)Special Symbols:-
                                           eg-*,@
                             6)Operators:-
                                           eg-++,/


Q-3. Explain different data types available in C.

 a:-There are four type of variable Data Type.
The primary data type and type and their extension are discussed in this section .The used -defined data types are defined in the next section while the derived data type such as arrays,fuctions,suctures and pointers  are discuountered.
ssed as and when theyare encontered.
There are 4 basics data type are:-
     1)char
     2)int
     3)float
     4)double
Many of them also offer extented data types such as long int and long double.



Q-4. Explain about backslash characters in C.
a:-  1)There are some characters which have special meaning in                C     Language.
      2)They should be preceded by backslash symbols function of           them.

          there are some backslash character:-
            \b,\f,\n,\r,\t,\",\',\\etc.
            \b:-Backspace
            \f:-form feed
             \n:-New line
             \r:-Carriage return
\t:-Horizontol tab
etc
